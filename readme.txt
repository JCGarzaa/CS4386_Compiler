Steps to Run This Program:
1. create an input file called 'input.txt' in the same directory as the source code. I pasted the given input into this file.
2. run 'make main' in the terminal. This will produce an executable file called 'main'.
3. run './main' in the terminal. This will produce a file called 'output.txt' which contains the lexer pairings output of the program. 
    If there is a syntax error during the parsing process, the program will print an error message to the terminal.
4. run 'cat output.txt' in the terminal to see the lexer output of the program.
